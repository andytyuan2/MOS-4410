# MOS 4410 Course Notes

## Intro Session:

-   Use IBIS World to access good data for the project
    -   Western has a subscription to it

## Week 1:

### Lecture 1:

**Guide to Case analysis**

1. Vision: why we do what we do - purpose
    1. Can be interchanged with mission
2. Mission: what do we do
    1. Industry, services, products
3. Business Model: How do we make money
    1. Different lines of business
4. Objectives: How we evaluate our progress
    1. Happy customers, more customers going towards profitable parts of business
    1. Gaining customers, others

**Case analysis heavily involves self reflection:**

- How can we improve, where are our strengths and where are our weaknesses?

*Western University Example*

1. Vision: destination of choice for the world's brightest minds seeking the best experience at a leading research university
2. Mission: to disseminate knowledge for the benefit of society through teaching, research, and scholarship. Graduates will be global citizens whose education and leadership will serve the public good.
3. Business model: 
    - Gov't grants - 38%
    - Student tuition - 35%
    - Sales and services - 15%
4. Objectives:
    - can possibly improve on how much tuition they can get
    - more sales and services, etc
    
### Reading for week 1

**Mission vs vision statements**

- Mission statement
    - Drives the company: what you do, the core, shapes company culture
    - Advances a team to a common goal
    - Weak missions lead to unmotivated teams
- Vision statement
    - About what you WANT the company to become
    - Questions like: what are our hopes and dreams?, what problem are we solving for the greater good?, who and what are we inspiring to change?
    - Promotes growth, innovation
    - weak vision leads to stagnation, uninspired teams
    
*Examples of brands that understand mission vs vision*

- Tesla
    - Mission: to accelerate transition to sustainable energy
    - Vision: to create the most compelling car company of the 21st century by driving transition to electric vehicles.
- Intel
    - Mission: Utilize the power of Moore's law to bring smart, connected devices to every person on Earth
    - Vision: if it is smart and connected, it is best with Intel
    
**Developing effective mission and vision statements**

- Ultimately, vision and mission help direct a new firm to develop a cohesive plan
    - Visions typically spell out goals at a high level and should coincide with what the founder wants the business to look like in terms of growth, values, societal contribution
    - Missions are a more concise version of the vision, and should be from the customer's perspective
- For mission statements: What do we do, how do we do it, for whom do we do it?
    - What do we do should be answered by needs that are fulfilled when product is bought
    - How do we do it should be answered by the more technical parts like supply chain, events, sales teams
    - For whom is the target to marketing efforts
        
**Business model basics**

- What a business will and won't do
- What the customer values, how do we make money?
- Knowing when your business model is slipping from the forefront is vital to staying ahead
    - Improvements can be more and more incremental
- Creating a new model can be down to 4 things
    - Changing mix of products or services
    - Postponing decisions
    - Changing the people who make decisions
    - Changing incentives in the value chain
    
*Some examples of basic business models*

- Cell phone
    - charging different rates for discrete levels of a service
- bundling
    - package related goods and services together
- low-touch
    - lower prices by decreasing service
- razor
  - Offer high margin product below cost to increase volume sales of low margin product
  - printers and ink
- reverse razor
  - offer low margin product below cost to increase volume of high margin product
  - ipod and itunes
  
**Defining Objectives**

- Ask yourself where you want to be in 3 months, 1 year, and 5 years
- Investigate what future trends may be
- Objectives should give you a competitive advantage
- Objectives should be SMART
    - Specific: what scale, industry
    - Measurable: how will you know if your objective is achieved?
    - Attainable: do you have enough resources for your goal? what will you do if you don't at the moment?
    - Relevant
    - Time-bound: when should it be done by?
    
## Week 2: 

### Lecture 2: 

**Porter's five forces model**

- Analyses industry attractive levels today
- Five competitive forces
    1. Threat of new entrants
        - if not many, why would there be not many?
            - Cost of start-up, storage, storefronts
        - if a lot, why is it so easy to join?
    2. Bargaining power of customers
        - comes from choice
        - low switching costs is bad, high bargaining power is when:
            - customers could also produce the product themselves
            - product is not of strategical importance for customer
            - customer knows of the costs of the product
        - high switching costs is good, low bargaining power
        - customers can effect products when they have a large opinion
    3. Threat of new substitutes
        - Substitutes are NOT competition
        - amazon may be a substitute for Walmart stores
    4. Bargaining power of suppliers
        - how much power of the supply does a supplier have?
        - If the supplier controls the supply of goods, then it is a bad thing
            - Particularly when:
                - buying industry is more profitable than the supplying industry: supplier may look to integrate forwards
                - economies of scale are provided for suppliers who integrate forwards
                - buying industry has low barrier to entry
        - If there are many suppliers, it is easy to switch
    5. Competitive rivalry within the industry
        - If there are large players, it might be hard to join
- Companies can use other tactics to bring in new customers after deciding if they should enter
    - financial
    - marketing
    - products or benefits
    
**Insights from the five forces model**

- Static analysis
- dynamic analysis
    - looking at changes over time
    - past, potential changes
- analysis of options

**Ways to reduce the bad of the five forces**

*Reducing the bargaining power of suppliers*

- partnering
- supply chain management
- take over a supplier
- improve relationships

*reducing bargaining power of customers*

- partnering
- increase loyalty
- increase incentives and value add
- move purchase decision away from price

*reducing threat of new entrants*

- patents
- increase customer loyalty
- retaliation tactics

*reducing threat of substitutes*

- legal action
- alliances
- accentuate either real or perceived differences

**criticism of the five forces model**

- assumes a perfect market
- regulation limits the model
- best for simple markets
- bad for collaborative markets
    
**Product life cycles and driving forces**
        
- Introduction
    - product branding and quality is established
    - pricing may be low penetration
    - distribution is selective
    - promotion is aimed at innovators and early adopters
- Growth
    - product quality is maintained and additional features
    - pricing is maintained as the firm enjoys increasing demand with little competition
    - distribution channels are added as demand increases
    - promotion is aimed at a broader audience
- Maturity
    - product may be enhanced to differentiate
    - pricing may be lower from competition
    - distribution becomes more intensive
    - promotion emphasizes product differentiation
- Decline
    - maintain product, possibly rejuvenate it
    - reduce costs and continue to market to niche audiences
    - discontinue and liquidate the remaining inventory
    
**PEST and PESTEL**

Political, economic, societal/social, technological forces (PEST), environmental, legal (PESTEL)

- Uses info about external environment to identify which areas represent opportunities or threats

*Political*

- gov't
- tariffs
- trade control
- freedom of press
- corruption
- regulation
- laws

*economic*

- rate of change in tech
- communication standard
- access to new tech
- legislation regarding tech
- tech incentives

### week 2 videos:

#### Porter's 5 forces extra notes

- unveils underlying forces behind what is causing profitability in the industry

##### Airlines

- rivalry is intense, low barriers to entry
- seen as a sexy industry, but it is one of the least profitable industries
    - instead, suppliers are extremely powerful like boeing, rolls-royce, etc

*The five forces can be applied to any industry, avoids being trapped by trends*

Rivalries
    - zero sum rivalries mean the customer wins with the least price, but no choice
    - positive sum rivalries are relevant to customers, companies compete on slightly different products

The framework is strongest when people are aligned together

#### PESTEL analysis extra notes

Used to analyze the external environment facing a business

- political
    - competition policy
    - government spending and tax policies
- economical
    - interest rates
    - exchange rates
    - consumer spending
- Social
    - demographic changes in the population
    - changing lifestyles
    - impact of pressure groups
        - ESG, social responsibility
- technological
    - disruptive technologies
        - e-commerce, mobile tech
    - new production processes
    - big data, AI, and dynamic pricing
- Legal: closely related to the political area
    - employment law
    - minimum wage
    - environmental legislation
- Environmental
    - sustainability
    - ethical sourcing
    - pollution and carbon emissions


## Week 3: 

### Lecture 1: diversification and global strategies

**Related diversification**

- Two involved businesses have meaningful commonalities, which provides synergies based on the exchange of skills or resources
- Improved ROI based on increased revenues or decreased costs because of commonalities
- Exchange or shared skills or assets which exploits:
    - Brand name
    - marketing skills
    - service operation
        - Pepsi buying Sodastream to diversify within the industry
    - Research and development and new product capability
    - excess capacity
    - economies of scale: more stuff you make, the more money you make
- Good example is Apple creating an entire ecosystem that works together seamlessly

**Unrelated diversification**

- Allows for cash flows to be more consistent
    - a seasonal company can acquire a non-seasonal one so their cash flows are good during most if not all months
- Firm restructuring can be done to reduce risk or make something more efficient, can be done to hedge if something falls
-  Defending against a takeover
- Vertical integration
    - Buying up suppliers or distribution
- providing executive interest


**Three tests for diversification**

1. How attractive is the industry that a firm is considering entering? 
    - Unless profits are almost guaranteed, it may be risky to enter
2. How much will it cost to enter the industry? 
    - Expenses related to diversifying must be absorbed by the business
3. Will the new unit and the firm be better off? 
    - Unless one side gains a competitive advantage, diversification should be avoided.
    
*Pepsi as an example*

- Pepsi buys sodastream for $3.2 Billion
    - It is a RELATED diversification
    - Sales are growing, so it looks like it is an attractive
    - Costs only $3.2 billion for pepsi, which is a small sum
    - Will be better off as they expand the product line
    
**Global strategies**

- Pressure to localize
    - consumer tastes and preferences
    - infrastructure
    - local laws
- pressure for cost reductions/lower costs
    - commodity type products should reduce costs since it is available everywhere, high consumer strength
    - universal needs of customers
    - competitors also do low cost

- Global strategy: high cost reduction pressure, low local pressure
    - Soft drinks
- Transnational strategy: high cost reduction pressure, high local pressure
    - Cars 
- International strategy: low cost reduction pressure, low local pressure
    - Pharmaceuticals that have patents
- Multi-domestic strategy: low cost reduction pressure, high local pressure
    - Law or accounting firm
    
**Entry Strategies**

Ordered from least to most amount of commitment, control, risk, and profit potential

- Licensing
    - Fast and cheap
    - Could be made poorly, which reflects poorly on the brand
- Exporting
    - Expensive to ship contents overseas
- Franchising
    - reoccurring revenue
    - bad franchisees can happen
- Contract manufacturing
- Joint venture and strategic alliances
    - pool of skill sets
    - different cultural values when you go international can exist
- Foreign direct investment
    - carries all the risk yourself
    
### Lecture 2: key success factors

**Fixed and variables costs**

- Fixed costs don't change
    - Rent, utilities, marketing
- variable costs
    - go up as a result of volume, typically are raw materials
    - commission

**break even analysis**

$$
\frac{Fixed}{\frac{revenue}{unit} - \frac{variable}{unit}}
$$

- used to examine impact of raising profits, lowering fixed or variable costs

**Profit pools**

- Where the industry could potentially make money
    - Charted profit pool: If market is new to you but exists
    - New and uncharted profit pools: New market for everyone
- Examples of profit pools
    - Automakers
        - Core: auto manufacturing
        - Highest ROI: leasing, insurance, service
    - Elevators
        - core: elevators
        - highest: service, repairs

**Key Success factors in an industry**

*Important to choose only 5-6 of these questions*

1. What important market trends are happening now?
    - Growth? Cycles? Innovations?
2. How important are our existing and new customers to our business?
    - 80% of money comes from 20% of customers
3. Why have competitors grown to the position that they now hold?
4. What are the largest cost areas of the business?
5. how important is research and development and market innovation?
6. Is our business capital intensive?
7. What worker and management skills are particularly crucial?
8. How important are sudden movements in currency and tax to the business?
9. How important is quality to our business? How do we and competitors maintain our quality?
10. How important is location to our business? Do we need to be in a special location? How do we compare with competition locations?

### week 3 videos

#### mcdonald's global and local strategies

1. local tastes and customs are essential to mcdonalds
    - beef is integral to the taste, but some countries don't have beef

2. local competition 
    - locales have evolved different fast food

3. local laws
    - alcohol sales

4. local franchises
    - local promotions are controlled by the franchisee to incentivize people to create franchisees

5. local people make it their way, food is cooked locally


#### key success factors

1. What do customers want?
2. How do firms compete?
    - Is it cutthroat or is there more space between the competition?
3. Are there any death bells?
    - Is there anything where if you have it, customers won't buy it?
    
#### strategic group mapping

used to see who the competition is

- Firms in same strategic group have two or more competitive characteristics in common
    - have comparable product line
    - sell in same price range and quality range
    - use the same product attributes to appeal to similar types of buyers
    - cover similar geographic areas

Procedure for constructing a strategic group map
    1. identify competitive characteristics that **DIFFERENTIATE** firms in an industry from one another
    2. plot firms on a two-variable map using pairs of these differentiating characteristics
        - eg, price vs breadth of menu
    3. the closer the firms are to one another on the map, the stronger the competitive rivalry is
        - direct competitors are within the same general group
    4. gaps in the mapping might indicate new business opportunities

## Week 4:

### Lecture 1: 

**Porter's Generic Strategies**

- Scope:
    - Broad (industry)
    - Narrow (market segment, low number of product breadth)
- Advantage:
    - Low cost
    - product uniqueness
- Strategies as a combination:
    - cost leadership strategy: low cost, broad scope
        - Eg, Walmart
    - differentiation strategy: unique product, broad scope
        - Eg, Apple
    - Focus strategy (low cost): low cost, narrow scope
        - Eg, easyjet: focused on business clients flying for cheap
    - Focus strategy (differentiation): unique product, narrow scope
        - Eg, Ferrari
    
    
**BCG Growth-Share matrix**

used for products within a firm

- Market Growth
    - Low and could be negative, high
- relative market share
    - low, high
    
1. Question marks: low market share, high market growth rate
2. Stars: high market share, high market growth rate
3. cash cows: low market growth rate, high market share
4. dogs: low market share, low market growth rate
    
- first two in intro and growth phases typically
- last two are in maturity and later stages in product cycle
    
**Structures in organizations**

- Functional structure
    - teams do their own thing; marketing, engineering, HR, etc
    - teams tend to not talk to each other this way
- Divisional structure
    - separate, semi-autonomous divisions
        - eg, divisions within cars like suv, sedans, vans
    - risks duplication
        - eg, radios, wheels, tires
  
### week 4 videos

#### porter's generic strategies

- cost leadership
- differentiation
    - always incentives to improve since competitors can copy your differences
- focus

## Week 5

### Lecture 1:

**SWOT**

- Strengths and weaknesses are internal
    - Related to key success factors
- Opportunities and threats are external to the company, more about the industry
- If strengths are stronger than the WOT
    - Focus on giving a recommendation based on the SWOT
- If WOT is stronger than the strengths
    - Focus on prioritizing

### week 5 videos

#### Blue ocean strategies

- companies should stop competing head on and instead look for wide oceans that make competition irrelevant
- look to non-customers, not customers; untapped potential that was used

#### disruptive innovation

Disruptive innovation is not a breakthrough, but instead is what happens when you transform a product that was expensive and complicated that only a few had access to it to something that is inexpensive and available

Innovator's dilemma

- Disruptive innovations force you to go after untapped customers for cheaper, instead of making a better product for a better profit


## Week 6

### lecture 1: financial performance

*Compound growth rates*

$$
CAGR = (\frac{end}{beginning})^{1/periods} - 1
$$

**Walmart review**

- Net sales, net income
- largest numbers we can find on their financial statements 
    - should see these numbers and provide value for the customers
- In analyzing the compound growth rate, net income growth rate being higher than revenue growth rate is good since it shows that you are controlling costs
    - However, operating cost rate should be lower than revenue growth rate
    

## Week 7

### Week 7 lectures SOuthwest airlines case:

#### Video 1: Industry

Five forces analysis

- Use high/low to categorize
    - High is bad, low is good

Some industries will have highly erratic life cycles that go up and down repeatedly

- Positive forces can also be negative forces, these two are not mutually exclusive

Global Strategies

- Matrix of pressure to lower costs and pressure to adapt locally


#### Video 2: competition and company analysis

financial analysis should be taken with a grain of salt, because large percent changes may be a result of a completely unrelated activity to service / goods such as buying another company

## Week 8:

### Week 8 lectures

If the vision of the company isn't clearly stated, clarify it
