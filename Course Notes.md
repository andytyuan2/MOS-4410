**Developing effective mission and vision statements**

- Ultimately, vision and mission help direct a new firm to develop a cohesive plan
    - Visions typically spell out goals at a high level and should coincide with what the founder wants the business to look like in terms of growth, values, societal contribution
    - Missions are a more concise version of the vision, and should be from the customer's perspective
- For mission statements: What do we do, how do we do it, for whom do we do it?
    - What do we do should be answered by needs that are fulfilled when product is bought
    - How do we do it should be answered by the more technical parts like supply chain, events, sales teams
    - For whom is the target to marketing efforts
        
**Business model basics**

- What a business will and won't do
- What the customer values, how do we make money?
- Knowing when your business model is slipping from the forefront is vital to staying ahead
    - Improvements can be more and more incremental
- Creating a new model can be down to 4 things
    - Changing mix of products or services
    - Postponing decisions
    - Changing the people who make decisions
    - Changing incentives in the value chain
