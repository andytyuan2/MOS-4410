### Reading for week 1

**Mission vs vision statements**

- Mission statement
    - Drives the company: what you do, the core, shapes company culture
    - Advances a team to a common goal
    - Weak missions lead to unmotivated teams
- Vision statement
    - About what you WANT the company to become
    - Questions like: what are our hopes and dreams?, what problem are we solving for the greater good?, who and what are we inspiring to change?
    - Promotes growth, innovation
    - weak vision leads to stagnation, uninspired teams
    
*Examples of brands that understand mission vs vision*

- Tesla
    - Mission: to accelerate transition to sustainable energy
    - Vision: to create the most compelling car company of the 21st century by driving transition to electric vehicles.
- Intel
    - Mission: Utilize the power of Moore's law to bring smart, connected devices to every person on Earth
    - Vision: if it is smart and connected, it is best with Intel
    
**Developing effective mission and vision statements**

- Ultimately, vision and mission help direct a new firm to develop a cohesive plan
    - Visions typically spell out goals at a high level and should coincide with what the founder wants the business to look like in terms of growth, values, societal contribution
    - Missions are a more concise version of the vision, and should be from the customer's perspective
- For mission statements: What do we do, how do we do it, for whom do we do it?
    - What do we do should be answered by needs that are fulfilled when product is bought
    - How do we do it should be answered by the more technical parts like supply chain, events, sales teams
    - For whom is the target to marketing efforts
        
**Business model basics**

- What a business will and won't do
- What the customer values, how do we make money?
- Knowing when your business model is slipping from the forefront is vital to staying ahead
    - Improvements can be more and more incremental
- Creating a new model can be down to 4 things
    - Changing mix of products or services
    - Postponing decisions
    - Changing the people who make decisions
    - Changing incentives in the value chain
    
*Some examples of basic business models*

- Cell phone
    - charging different rates for discrete levels of a service
- bundling
    - package related goods and services together
- low-touch
    - lower prices by decreasing service
- razor
  - Offer high margin product below cost to increase volume sales of low margin product
  - printers and ink
- reverse razor
  - offer low margin product below cost to increase volume of high margin product
  - ipod and itunes
  
**Defining Objectives**

- Ask yourself where you want to be in 3 months, 1 year, and 5 years
- Investigate what future trends may be
- Objectives should give you a competitive advantage
- Objectives should be SMART
    - Specific: what scale, industry
    - Measurable: how will you know if your objective is achieved?
    - Attainable: do you have enough resources for your goal? what will you do if you don't at the moment?
    - Relevant
    - Time-bound: when should it be done by?
    
## Week 2: 

### Lecture 2: 

**Porter's five forces model**

- Analyses industry attractive levels today
- Five competitive forces
    1. Threat of new entrants
        - if not many, why would there be not many?
            - Cost of start-up, storage, storefronts
        - if a lot, why is it so easy to join?
    2. Bargaining power of customers
        - comes from choice
        - low switching costs is bad, high bargaining power
        - high switching costs is good, low bargaining power
        - customers can effect products when they have a large opinion
    3. Threat of new substitutes
        - Substitutes are NOT competition
        - amazon may be a substitute for Walmart stores
    4. Bargaining power of suppliers
        - how much power of the supply does a supplier have?
        - If the supplier controls the supply of goods, then it is a bad thing
        - If there are many suppliers, it is easy to switch
    5. Competitive rivalry within the industry
        - If there are large players, it might be hard to join
- Companies can use other tactics to bring in new customers after deciding if they should enter
    - financial
    - marketing
    - products or benefits
    
**Product life cycles and driving forces**
        
- Introduction
    - product branding and quality is established
    - pricing may be low penetration
    - distribution is selective
    - promotion is aimed at innovators and early adopters
- Growth
    - product quality is maintained and additional features
    - pricing is maintained as the firm enjoys increasing demand with little competition
    - distribution channels are added as demand increases
    - promotion is aimed at a broader audience
- Maturity
    - product may be enhanced to differentiate
    - pricing may be lower from competition
    - distribution becomes more intensive
    - promotion emphasizes product differentiation

    - reduce costs and continue to market to niche audiences
    - discontinue and liquidate the remaining inventory
    
**PEST and PESTEL**
