## *Industry*

#### Five forces (What an industry looks like today)
    1. Threat of new entrants
        - If not many, why would there be not many?
            - High cost of start, storage, need storefronts, brand recognition, distribution channels, regulations
        - If there are a lot, why is it so easy to join?
            - Cost to start, low storage needs, no storefronts
    2. Bargaining power of customers
        - Choice that consumers make influences their bargaining power
        - High bargaining power is when switching cost is low
            - Customers could also produce the product themselves
            - Product is not of strategical importance for customer
            - Customer knows of the costs of the product
        - Low consumer bargaining power is when switching costs are high
            - We provide a unique product
            - We can have a competitive price
        - Customers can effect products when they have a large opinion
    3. Threat of new substitutes
        - Substitutes are NOT competition
            - Amazon may be a substitute for Walmart stores
            - However, they do not directly compete with one another
    4. Bargaining power of suppliers
        - How much power of the supply does a supplier have?
        - The less suppliers, the more power they hold
        - If suppliers can move into the purchaser's industry, then they have more power
            - Economies of scale may be available if they integrate forwards
        - If suppliers have multiple other clients, then it has more power
        - If there are many suppliers, it is easy to switch
    5. Competitive rivalry within the industry
        - Hard to join if big rivals exist
        - Stagnating industries may have to fight for customers more
        - If it is difficult to LEAVE the industry, then it leads to more competition
        
#### Industry/Product life cycle
    1. Introduction
        - Product branding and quality is established
        - Pricing may be low penetration
        - Distribution is limited, but also strategic
        - Promotion is aimed at innovators and early adopters
    2. Growth
        - Product quality is maintained and additional features are added
        - Pricing is maintained as demand increases
        - Distribution channels are added
        - Promotion begins to be aimed at a broader audience
    3. Maturity
        - Product may be enhanced further to differentiate it from competitors
        - Pricing may be lowered to compete
        - Distribution is the most widespread it gets
        - Promotion is to a broad audience, emphasizing differentiation
    4. Decline
        - Maintaining product quality and price, possibly rejuvenate it somehow
        - Reduce costs and continue to market, but to niche audiences rather than broad
        - At the end, discontinue and liquidate the remaining inventory

#### Diversification strategies
    Related Diversification
        - Meaningful commonalities provide synergies based on the exchange of skills or resources
        - Improves return on investment because of reduced cost or increased revenue
        - Exchanges or shares skills or assets to exploit...
            - Brand name
            - Marketing skill
            - Service operation; eg, Pepsi buys Sodastream
            - Research and development capabilities
            - Excess capacity
            - Economies of scale
        - Prime example: Apple creating the Apple ecosystem
    
    Unrelated diversification
        - Two seemingly unrelated business join to create synergies from skills or resources
            - A ski business may buy a pool company to decrease seasonality
        - Improves consistency of cash flow
        - Hedges risks of a single business failing
        - Defends against takeovers
        - Provides executive interest
        
    **Tests of Attractiveness**
        1. How attractive is the industry from a firm who is considering entering?
        2. How much will it cost to enter the industry?
        3. Will the new unit and the firm be better off?
        
#### Global/Entry strategies

        - Reduce costs
            - Find local distribution channels
            - Universal customer needs

#### Economic traits
    Nature of costs in the industry and profit pools
    **Profit Pools**
        - Where the industry could potentially make money
            - Charted profit pool: if market is new to you but exists
            - New and uncharted profit pool: new market for everyone
        - Profit pool examples
            - Core: car manufacturing, highest ROI: leasing, insurance
    **Break even analysis**
    
$$
\frac{Fixed}{\frac{revenue}{unit} - \frac{variable}{unit}}
$$
    
#### Key success factors - Only pick up to 5 of these questions
    1. What important market trends are happening now?
        - Growth? Cycles? Innovations?
    2. How important are our existing and new customers to our business?
        - 80% of money comes from 20% of customers
    3. Why have competitors grown to the position that they now hold?
    4. What are the largest cost areas of the business?
    5. how important is research and development and market innovation?
    6. Is our business capital intensive?
    7. What worker and management skills are particularly crucial?
    8. How important are sudden movements in currency and tax to the business?
    9. How important is quality to our business? How do we and competitors maintain our quality?
    10. How important is location to our business? Do we need to be in a special location? How do we compare with competition locations?
    

## *Competition*

- Competitive intelligence
    - Strengths and weaknesses of rivals relative to key success factors
    
#### Strategic group map (If available)
    Procedure for constructing a strategic group map
    1. identify competitive characteristics that **DIFFERENTIATE** firms in an industry from one another
    2. plot firms on a two-variable map using pairs of these differentiating characteristics
        - eg, price vs breadth of menu
    3. the closer the firms are to one another on the map, the stronger the competitive rivalry is
        - direct competitors are within the same general group
    4. gaps in the mapping might indicate new business opportunities


## *Company*

#### Current business strategy
    Scope: broad vs narrow, breadth of products sold
    
    Low cost and product uniqueness
    
    Strategies as a combination:
    - cost leadership strategy: low cost, broad scope
        - Eg, Walmart
    - differentiation strategy: unique product, broad scope
        - Eg, Apple
    - Focus strategy (low cost): low cost, narrow scope
        - Eg, easyjet: focused on business clients flying for cheap
    - Focus strategy (differentiation): unique product, narrow scope
        - Eg, Ferrari
    - Does it make sense?
        - Why? or Why not?
        
- Diversification strategies
- Global strategies
- How well has the current strategy been executed financially?

#### Portfolio analysis - BCG Matrix
    Growth rate can be negative

    1. Question marks: low market share, high market growth rate
    2. Stars: high market share, high market growth rate
    3. cash cows: low market growth rate, high market share
    4. dogs: low market share, low market growth rate
    
- Organizational structure, design, and governance
- Corporate culture, social responsibilities
- Implications of the above

### **SWOT**

- Strengths
- Weaknesses
- Opportunities
- Threats

- Strengths and weaknesses are internal
    - Related to key success factors
- Opportunities and threats are external to the company, more about the industry
- If strengths are stronger than the WOT
    - Focus on giving a recommendation based on the SWOT
- If WOT is stronger than the strengths
    - Focus on prioritizing
